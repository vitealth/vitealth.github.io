    <li style="color:red">The sensor is connected to your smartphone wirelessly via Bluetooth 4.0. When you open the application, it will automatically turn on Bluetooth and connect to measure your sleep. The Bluetooth connection is made automatically using our application without needing a password for pairing using our secure channel. You don't have to find our sensor on Android's Bluetooth setting.<br>

</ol> 
<br>

<ul>
<li><b>The sensor is rolled up when you take the sensor out of the box, and needs time to unroll itself. Take the sensor out of the box, unroll it on the bed, and wait for 3 to 6 hours in order to let it unroll completely. Use the app to complete sensor installation. If you first put the sensor on the bed in the evening, start using it the next day.</b></li>
<li>Respio sensor is not rechargeable. It can measure your sleeps only when the power is continuously provided.</li>
<br>
<li style="color:red"><b>Charge your smartphone while measuring your sleep. Since your sleep quality is continuously monitored using sensor data, your smartphone battery may become discharged unless you charge it over night.</b></li>
<br>
</ul>

<br><br>

    <li>You shouldn't wear the sensor on your waist like a belt. It should be placed on your bed.</li>
    <li>The sensor is very delicate. Do not fold the sensor completely like a sheet of paper.</li>
    <li>The sensor may be damaged if you put a great stress on it, such as jumping on the bed with your sensor on it.</li>
    <li>Do not let the sensor touch water. There will not be risk of electric shock but the sensor will be damaged.</li>
