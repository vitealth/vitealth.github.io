<h2>Sleep Apnea - Risks and Diagnosis&nbsp;</h2>
<p>Sleep apnea is a common sleep disorder characterized by repeated interruptions in breathing during sleep. These interruptions are caused by the collapse of soft tissue in the airway. Sleep apnea disrupts the sleep cycle and can dramatically impact energy and mental performance.</p>

<p>If you have symptoms of sleep apnea during sleep, you can get a polysomnography test for $1,000 or more at the sleep center. However, you don’t have to.</p>
<p>We have developed a new sensor RESPIO that can measure sleep apnea easily and simply at home. You can test sleep apnea with RESPIO at 1/20 the price of the Polysomnography test.<img src="https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1534145495/x8xiag3rudjnwtkojuct.png" /></p>

<h2>RESPIO APP</h2>
<p><img src="https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1535607534/uqifxh7rhbtlh3umrkgo.png" />While sleeping, RESPIO App measures breathing with RESPIO Sensor and finds sleep apnea. It records sounds by using your smartphone microphone and finds snoring.
    <br />Our technology does not only rely on sensor measurements but uses snoring sounds together to detect sleep apnea more accurately.<img src="https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1533975383/kg6z3mpq8wog4brhufwb.png" /></p>

    <p style="text-align: left;">Respio app records sounds by using your smartphone microphone and finds snoring. It never records except when snoring.&nbsp;All snoring sounds are encrypted and stored in a file which cannot be accessed except by you.</p>
    <h3 style="text-align: left;">Alarm Sleep Apnea</h3> <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vitealth/vitealth.github.io/master/gif/%EC%B5%9C%EC%A2%85_20180829_apean_alarm.gif" />
    <p style="text-align: left;">Whenever apnea for 10 seconds or more is detected during your sleep the vibration will alert you to increase the chance of you unconsciously changing your sleep position, diminishing the sleep apnea.</p>
    <h3 style="text-align: left;">Understand Causes of Sleep Apnea</h3></div>
<p>RESPIO App analyzes your sleep apnea and life patterns to find the most likely cause with machine learning techniques. RESPIO App collects the physical information and the daily activities of the user when measuring sleep apnea. By analyzing sleep apnea and activities for more than two weeks, we find the factors that have the greatest effect on sleep apnea. Users will be able to manage the factors that have the greatest effect on sleep apnea and gradually reduce symptoms.</p>
<p><img src="https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1535606059/i3je5m0n5r5pmr78inik.png" />For sleep apnea analysis, RESPIO App collects the following physical information;
    <br /><strong>Gender</strong>, <strong>Height</strong>, <strong>Weight</strong>, <strong>Medical History</strong> and so on.</p>
<p>Daily activity factors include;
    <br /><strong>Alcohol, Caffeine, Smoking, Fever, Work out, Medicine, Stuffy nose, Shower, Sunlight exposure, Stress, Change of sleep environment</strong> and so on.</p>
<p>RESPIO would never force you to enter your personal information and daily activities to analyze sleep apnea if you are concerned about your privacy. &nbsp;</p>
<h3>Share Sleep Apnea Data</h3>
<p><img src="https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1535606125/ebghdi5h0imh8cvnqjvt.png" /></p>
<p>A user can allow a spouse, parent, or other members of their family to view their sleep apnea result.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<h2>Additional features</h2>
<p><strong>&lt;Respio Sensor&gt;</strong></p>
<p>Our unique sensor with Integrated breathing measurement technology.&nbsp;The interior features a pressure sensor. The exterior is made of 100% cotton.&nbsp;Respio sensor transmits breath signal to Respio App via Bluetooth 4.0. It’s powered from a Y-shaped power cable included with the package.</p>
<p>Sensor Dimensions: 32”(length) X 1.5”(Width) X 0.06(Thickness)</p>
<p><img src="https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1534128092/t1lrft4qdyaflfaq1dbl.png" /></p>
<p><strong>&lt;Y-shaped power cable&gt;</strong></p>
<p>With user test feedback we have developed a unique and convenient USB Y-shaped power cable. It can deliver power to RESPIO Sensor on the mattress and your smartphone at the same time. The USB connector at the end of the long cable is connected to Respio Sensor and USB connector at the end of short cable is connected to your smartphone installed with the Respio App. You can clean up the complex power cables that connect the sensor and the smartphone.</p>
<p><img src="https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1534128245/tdzgqldlaskmwcwznmui.png" /><strong>&lt;Safety&gt;</strong></p>
<p>We added many safety circuits and tried various tests because Respio Sensor is installed on bed mattress during sleep. Many people have worried about electrical shocks or fire from the sensor.&nbsp;</p>
<p>(1) Safety against moisture</p>
<p>Respio Sensor operates at 3.3v. 3.3 V is not dangerous because it is as low as two typical batteries(1.5v x 2). We had an experiment to pour water into the sensor to check electrical safety. The sensor worked normally and there was no electrical leakage.</p>

</div>
<h3></h3>
<p>(2) Don’t worry about the effect of electromagnetic radiation,</p>
<p>We have already tested RESPIO in an anechoic chamber with&nbsp;EMI Tester.&nbsp; Electromagnetic waves are released at a safe level from 9 dBuV/m to 18 dBuV/m.</p>
<p><img src="https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1534034282/oogsezx3tlg72uxfpj7y.png" /></p>
<h2>Set up</h2>
<p>Place the sensor on a bed mattress and cover the sensor with a bedsheet. The sensor should be placed between your chest and abdomen. RESPIO works best if the thickness of the sheet is less than 2 inches.</p>

</div>
<p>You can download ‘RESPIO’ app from the Apple app store or the google play store. After running the app, Bluetooth pairing should be done. It’s paired automatically if you use only one RESPIO.</p>
<h2><br />RESPIO Technologies</h2>
<p>RESPIO sensor measures subtle pressure changes caused by chest and abdomen movement. The chest and abdomen move according to the breath. Respio sensor placed on the mattress, measures the movement of the chest and abdomen during respiration.</p>
<p><img src="https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1534136507/kzww4whukez0kg1mrzhq.png" /></p>
<p>When you breathe in, your chest and abdomen both expand at the same time. The sensor detects this movement. So when you breathe in, the sensor graph steeply increases.</p>
<p>When you breathe out,&nbsp;your chest and abdomen both return back to the original shape.&nbsp; Respio sensor detects this contraction, and the sensor graph decreases.</p>

<p>This video shows the change of the sensor value on a desk, not a bed, for the sensor test. It shows the signal changes when I touch the sensor by hand for sensor test. When I apply force to the sensor with my fingers, the sensor value increases greatly, and when I release the sensor, the sensor value decreases. The oscilloscope next to the laptop also shows the same results.</p>

<p>Q: How do I connect it with my smartphone?</p>
<p>A: Just follow the instructions in the tutorial.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Q: Can I use it with a pet during sleep?</p>
<p align="left">A: No. Respio can measure only one respiration signal. If you&nbsp;share&nbsp;the bed with your pet, the Respio cannot measure your sleep apnea.</p>
<p align="left"></p>
<p>&lt;RESPIO App&gt;</p>
<p>Q: What platforms do you support?</p>
<p>A: We support iOS and Android. You can download RESPIO App in the Apple's App Store or Google Play Store.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Q: Will the App have version updates?</p>
<p>A: Yes. Regular version updates will be available.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Q: How does it record snoring sounds?</p>
<p>A: We use the smartphone microphone. If you want to record sound of snoring, you should place the smartphone next to your bed. Of course, if you do not want to record snoring, you may not record.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Q: Could the recording of snoring lead to privacy problems?</p>
<p>A: The Respio app does not record all of the sounds during the entire sleeping period. It obtains a 40-second clip and stores it in the smartphone’s private storage when it detects snoring. It never records except when snoring. All snoring sounds are encrypted and stored in a file which can not be accessed except by you.</p>
