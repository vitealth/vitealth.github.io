ARBITRATION PREVENTS YOU FROM SUING IN COURT OR FROM HAVING A JURY TRIAL.

<p>You and Respio agree that you will notify each other of any dispute within 30 days of when it arises, that you will attempt informal resolution prior to any demand for arbitration, that arbitration will be conducted confidentially by a single arbitrator.
